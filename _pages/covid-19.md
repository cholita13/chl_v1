## Our loyal, valued and LOVED customers and community

It is with heavy hearts we write this announcement, that [Cholita Linda](/) will be closing both of our Dine In locations until further notice.

We have a lot to figure out going forward and will do so to the best of our ability.

We will be switching over for the time being to take out / delivery only and appreciate your ongoing love and support. We are not only proud members of this amazing community, but members of our own beloved families and parents to children, ourselves. We're taking all of our safety and health very seriously and commit to uphold the highest standards of safety.

For the time being, both our [Oakland](https://www.toasttab.com/cholita-linda-temescal-4923-telegraph-ave/v3) and [Alameda](https://www.toasttab.com/cholita-linda-alameda-1337-park-st/v3) locations will provide take out as well as delivery. Our hours will be determined daily, for now, but downloading our new takeout app or using our delivery partners will ensure you have up to date daily hours.

Again, our team is grateful for the ongoing love and support you have all offered us for many years and we look forward to taking care of you as well during this time.

With Love,
Cholita Linda ‚ù§Ô∏èüå¥
